
## CTSC - Microservice Prototype Project
### Welcome to the Microservice Prototype Project! This repository documents the design and implementation of a secure, microservice-based application component, showcasing fundamental DevOps practices and cloud capabilities.

## Objective
### The objective of this project is to design and implement a prototype of a secure, microservice-based application component leveraging basic DevOps practices and cloud capabilities.

## Assignment Overview
### Our group is tasked with creating a prototype for a single, key component of a larger microservice-based application. This prototype will be deployed on a public cloud service provider, demonstrating basic DevOps practices, security considerations including DevSecOps practices, and utilizing cloud capabilities.

## Specific Tasks
## Design a Simple Microservice (LO1, LO3)
### Chose a core component: We selected a product catalog for e-commerce.
### Functionality and endpoints: Detailed in the documentation within the repository.
### Programming language/framework: [Insert your choice here].
### Implement Basic DevOps Practices (LO1, LO2)
### Version control system: Hosted publicly on [insert version control system].
### CI/CD pipelines: Automated build and deployment process using [insert CI/CD tool].
### Containerize the Microservice using Docker (LO3, LO4)
### Containerization: Implemented using Docker.
### Container registry: Hosted on [insert container registry service].
### Deploy the Microservice (LO2, LO4)
### Managed container orchestration: Utilizing [insert cloud-specific service].
### Accessibility: Microservice accessible over the internet.
### Integrate Basic Security Measures (LO2, LO4)
### Security best practices: Implemented using IAM roles, security groups, etc.
### Data security: Follows principles of least privilege.
### Managed SAST tools: Integrated SonarCloud/Snyk for DevSecOps practices.
